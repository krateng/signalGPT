## SignalGPT

This started off as a frontend for the OpenAI API in order to have different personas for the AI that specialize in different topics and have their own characters.
Now it can pretty much be used as a sort of AI companion - the AI can now send memes, selfies, introduce you to their friends, rename the group chat for comedic effect etc. :D

It is highly recommended to use GPT-4 for longer chats, and almost obligatory for meta-prompts - but this can get very expensive. Check your usage statistics regularly!
